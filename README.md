Hello, thank you for your interest, this is an educational project
with the aim of developing a website using the programming languages
Python, HTML, CSS and MySQL. In the construction I also used the Flask
Framework.
The website chosen was Pinterest, so we made a simple copy of it,
providing registration of new users, secure logins verifications and
authentication. An option to upload photos and view photos shared by
other users has been added to the website. New users are stored in a
password-encrypted MySql database.
